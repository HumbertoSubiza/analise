## analise package

This is the first R package I made, following examples from Hillary ParkerÂ´s "Writing an R package from scratch" 
and also documentation from `roxygen2` and Hadley Wickman "R Packages"

It just contains a "resumo" function, summary of several simples _R_ Base functions as mean(), max(), sd()...
a ce90 and le90 functions, to calculate the 90% value of a dataset, and the EQM function to calculate the RMSE.
